        "The Principles of Communism* \nIn 1847 Engels wrote two draft programmes for the Communis t League in the form of a catechism, \none in June and the other in October. The latter, which is known as Principles of Communism , was \nfirst published in 1914. The earlier document \u201c Draft of the Communist Confession of Faith\u201d , was only \nfound in 1968. It was  first published in 1969 in Hamburg, together with four other documents \npertaining to the first congress of the Communist League, in a booklet entitled Gr\u00fcndungs Dokumente \ndes Bundes der Kommunisten (Juni bis September 1847)  [Founding Documents of the Comm unist \nLeague] . \nAt the June 1847 Congress of the League of the Just, which was also the founding conference of the Communist League, it was decided to issue a draft \u201c confession of faith \u201d to be submitted for discussion",

In Principles of Communism , Engels left three questions unanswered, in two cases  \nwith the notation \u201c unchanged\u201d  (bleibt); this clearly refers to the answers provided in the earlier draft.  \nThe new draft for the programme was worked out by Engels on the instructions of the leading body of the Paris circle of the Communist League. The ins tructions were decided on after Eng els\u2019 sharp \ncriticism at the committee meeting, on October 22, 1847, of the draft programme drawn up by the \u201ctrue socialist\u201c  Moses Hess, which was then rejected.  \nStill considering Principles of Communism as a preliminary d raft, Engels expressed the view, in a \nletter to Marx dated November 23 -24 1847, that it would be best to drop the old catechistic form and",

The machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the big capitalists and \nrendered entirely worthless the meagre property of the worker s (tools, looms, etc.). The result was \nthat the capitalists soon had everything in their hands and nothing remained to the workers. This \nmarked the introduction of the factory system into the textile industry.  \nOnce the impulse to the introduction of machi nery and the factory system had been given, this \nsystem spread quickly to all other branches of industry, especially cloth - and book- printing, \npottery, and the metal industries.  \nLabor was more and more divided among the individual workers so that the work er who \npreviously had done a complete piece of work now did only a part of that piece.

In this way, all these industries fell, one after another, under the dominance of steam, machinery, and the factory system, just as spinning and \nweaving had already done.  \nBut a t the same time, they also fell into the hands of big capitalists, and their workers were \ndeprived of whatever independence remained to them.
