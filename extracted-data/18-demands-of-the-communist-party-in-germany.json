        "Demands of the Communist Party in Germany \n\u201cDemands of the Communist Party in Germany \u201d were written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in \nParis between March 21 (when Engels arr ived in Paris from Brussels) and March 24, 1848. This \ndocument was discussed by members of the Central Authority, who approved and signed it as the. \npolitical programme of the Communist League in the revolution that broke out in Germany. In March \nit was pr inted as a leaflet, for distribution among revolutionary German emigrant workers who were \nabout to return home. Austrian and German diplomats in Paris informed their respective governments \nabout this as early as March 27, 28 and 29.

At the Second Democratic Congress held in Berlin in October \n1848, Friedrich Beust, delegate from the Cologne Workers \u2019 Association, spoke, on behalf of the social \nquestion commission, in favour of adopting a programme of action cl osely following the \u201c Demands \u201d. \nIn November and December 1848, various points of the \u201cDemands \u201d were discussed at meetings of the \nCologne Workers \u2019 Association.
