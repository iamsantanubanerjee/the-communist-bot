        "Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith*  \nThis document is the draft  programme discussed at the First Congress of the Communist League in \nLondon on June 2- 9, 1847.  \nThe Congress was a final stage in the reorganisation of the League of the Just \u2013 an organisation of \nGerman workers and craftsmen, which was founded in Paris in 1836- 37 and soon acquired an \ninternational character, having communities in Germany, France, Switzerland, Britain and Sweden. The activity of Marx and Engels directed towards the ideological and organisational unity of the \nsocialists and advanced workers p rompted the leaders of the League (Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll, \nHeinrich Bauer), who resided in London front November 1846, to ask for their help in reorganising the League and drafting its new program me.

The League was renamed the Communist League, the old motto of the League of the Just \u201c All men are brothers \u201d was replaced by a new, Marxist one: \u201c Working \nMen of All Countries, Unite! \u201c  The draft programme and the draft Rules of the League were approved \nat the last sitting on June 9, 1847.  \nThe full text of the \u201c Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith\u201d  (Credo) became known only in 1968. \nIt was found by the Swiss scholar Bert Andr\u00e9as together with the draft Rules and the circular of the First Congress to the members of the League in the archives of Joachim Friedrich Martens, an active",

It had been previously assumed that \nthe First Congress did no more than adopt a decision to draw up a progra mme and that the draft itself \nwas made by the London Central Authority of the Communist League (Joseph Moll, Karl Schapper and Heinrich Bauer) after the Congress between June and August 1847. The new documents show that \nthe draft was ready by June 9, 1847 and that its author was Engels (the manuscript found in Martens \u2019 \narchives, with the exception of some inserted words, the concluding sentence and the signatures of the \npresident and the secretary of the Congress, was written in Engels \u2019 hand).  \nThe document testifies to Engels \u2019 great influence on the discussion of the programme at the Congress",

Besides, while drafting the programme, Engels had to take into account that the members of t he League had not yet freed \nthemselves from the influence of utopian ideas and this was reflected in the formulation of the first six \nquestions and answers. The form of a \u201c revolutionary catechism \u201d was also commonly used in the \nLeague of the Just and other organisations of workers and craftsmen at the time. It may he assumed \nthat Engels intended to give greater precision to some  of the formulations of the programme document \nin the course of further discussion and revision. \nAfter the First Congress of the Com munist League , the \u201c Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith\u201d",

But there have not always been proletarians, \njust as competition has not always been free.  \nQuestion 9 : How did the proletariat arise?  \nAnswer : The proletariat came into being as a result of the introduction of the \nmachines which have been invented since the middle of the last century and the \nmost important of which are: the steam -engine, the s pinning machine and the \npower loom.

In the case of the proletarian it is determined by competition, therefore in the first place by the bourgeois. The \nserf has guaran teed subsistence, the proletarian has not. The serf frees himself by \ndriving out his feudal lord and becoming a property owner himself, thus entering \ninto competition and joining for the time being the possessing class, the privileged \nclass.

His aim is to acquire capital himself and so to \nexploit other workers. He can often achieve this aim where the craft guilds still \nexist or where freedo m to follow a trade has not yet led to the organisation of \nhandwork on a factory basis and to intense competition.
