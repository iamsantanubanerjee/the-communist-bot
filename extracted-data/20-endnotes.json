        "67 Third Address to the International Working Men\u2019s Association, May 1871  \nEndnotes  \n \n1 The first Russian translation of the Manifesto of the Communist Party was made by Bakunin, who \ndespite being one of Marx and Engels \u2019 most pronounced opponents in the working class movement, \nsaw the great revolutionary importance contained within the Manifesto . Published in Geneva in 1869 \n(printing it in Russia was impossible due to state censorship), Bakunin\u2019  s translation was not \ncompletely accurate, and was replaced a decade later by Plekhanov \u2019s translation in 1882, for which \nboth Marx and Engels wrote a preface.  \n2 A reference to the events that occurred in Russia after the assassination, on March, 1, 1881, of \nEmperor Alexander II by Narodnaya Volya  members.

The workers put forward the demand for an \n8 hour working day and other demands set forth by the Congress. From that day forward workers all \nover the world celebrate the first of May as a day of international proletarian solidarity.  \n4 A reference to the movement for an electoral reform which, under the pre ssure of the working class, \nwas passed by the British House of Commons in 1831 and finally endorsed by the House of Lords in June, 1832.
