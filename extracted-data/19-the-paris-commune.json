In 1891, on the 20th anniversary of the Paris Commune, Engels \nput together a new collection of the work. Engels decided to include the first two addresses that \nMarx made to the International.  \nThe Address is included here because it can be regarded as an amendment to the Manifesto , \nclarifying a number of issues relating to the state based on the experience of the Commune.  \nOn the dawn of March 18, Paris arose to the thunder -burst of \u201c Vive la Commune! \u201d What is the \nCommune, that sphinx so tantalizing to the bourgeois mind?",

At the \nsame pace at which the progress of modern industry developed, widened, intensified the class \nantagonism between capital and labor, the state power assumed more and more the character of \nthe national power of capital over labor, of a pub lic force organized for social enslavement, of an \nengine of class despotism."
