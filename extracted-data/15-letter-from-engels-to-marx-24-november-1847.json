        "Letter from Engels to Marx , 24 November 1847* \nParis, 23-24 November 1847  \nDear Marx,  \nNot until this evening was it decided that I should be coming. Saturday evening, then, in Ostend, \nH\u00f4tel de la Couronne, just opposite the railway station beside the harbour, and Sunday morning \nacross the water. If you take the train that leaves between 4 and 5, you \u2019ll arrive at about the \nsame time as I do.  ... \nTuesday evening  \nVerte  [PTO]  \nGive a little thought to the \u201c Confession of Faith. \u201d I think we would do best to abandon the \ncatechetical form and call the thi ng \u201cCommunist Manifesto .\u201d Since a certain amount of history \nhas to be narrated in it, the form hitherto adopted is quite unsuitable. I shall be bringing with me \nthe one from here, which I did [ \u201cPrinciples of Communism \u201d]; it is in simple narrative form, but",
        "the one from here, which I did [ \u201cPrinciples of Communism \u201d]; it is in simple narrative form, but \nwretchedly worded, in a tearing hurry. I start off by asking: What is communism? and then straight on to the proletariat \u2013 the history of its origins, how it differs from earlier workers, \ndevelopme nt of the antithesis between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, crises, conclusions. In \nbetween, all kinds of secondary matter and, finally, the communists \u2019 party policy, in so far as it \nshould be made public. The one here has not yet been submitted in i ts entirety for endorsement \nbut, save for a few quite minor points, I think I can get it through in such a form that at least there is nothing in it which conflicts with our views.  ... \n \n                                                      \n* From MECW Volume 38, p. 146;  Written: 24 November 1847; First published: in  Der Briefwechsel zwischen F. \nEngels und K. Marx , 1913."
