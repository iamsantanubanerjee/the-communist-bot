        "II. Proletarians and Communists \nIn what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?  \nThe Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working -class parties.  \nThey have no interests separate and apart from those of  the proletariat as a whole.  \nThey do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the \nproletarian movement.  \nThe Communists are distinguished from the other working- class parties by this only: 1. In the \nnational struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the \nfront the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the \nvarious stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has \nto pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.",
        "various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has \nto pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.  \nThe Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working- class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all \nothers; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the \nadvantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general \nresults of the prole tarian movement.  \nThe immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of \npolitical power by the proletariat.  \nThe theoretical co nclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that",

The abolition of existing property \nrelations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.  \nAll property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent \nupon t he change in historical conditions.  \nThe French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.  \nThe distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the \nabolition of bourgeois property .

But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most \ncomplete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.  \nIn this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition \nof private property.  \nWe Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally \nacquiring property as the fruit of a man\u2019 s own labour, which property is alleged to be t he \ngroundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.  \nHard -won, self -acquired, self -earned property!

Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that \nkind of property which exploits wage -labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of \nbegetting a new supply of wage -labour for fresh exploitation.

Let us examine both sides of this \nantagonism.  \nTo be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status  in production. Capital \nis a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, \nonly by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.  \nCapital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.  \nWhen, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of \nsociety, personal pr operty is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social \ncharacter of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.  \nLet us now take wage -labour.  \nThe average price of wage- labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of \nsubsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer.",

We by no means  intend to abolish this personal \nappropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and \nreproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of \nothers. All that we want to do away wi th is the miserable character of this appropriation, under \nwhich the labourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the \ninterest of the ruling class requires it.  \nIn bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to in crease accumulated labour.

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the \nliving person is dependent and has no individuality.  \nAnd the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and \nfreedom! And r ightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and \nbourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.  \nBy freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying.  \nBut if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also.

Precisely so; that  is \njust what we intend.  \nFrom the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a \nsocial power capable of being monopolised, i.e. , from the moment when individual property can \nno longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say, \nindividuality vanishes."
