        "IV. Position of the Communists in Relation to the \nVarious Existing Opposition Parties  \nSection II  has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working- class parties, \nsuch as the Chartists  in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America.  \nThe Commu nists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the \nmomentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent \nand take care of the future of that movement. In France, the Communists ally with the Social-\nDemocrats* against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take \nup a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great \nRevolution.  \nIn Switzerland, they support t he Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists \nof antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.",
        "of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.  \nIn Poland, they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as  the prime condition for \nnational emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.  \nIn Germany, they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the \nabsolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and t he petty bourgeoisie.  \nBut they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the working class the clearest possible \nrecognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the \nGerman workers may straightway use, as so  many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social \nand political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, \nand in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the \nbourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.",
        "and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the \nbourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.  \nThe Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a \nbourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European \ncivilisation and with a much more  developed proletariat than that of England was in the \nseventeenth, and France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution.  \nIn short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing \nsocial and political order of things.  \nIn all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property \nquestion, no matter what its degree of development at  the time.  \nFinally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all",
        "question, no matter what its degree of development at  the time.  \nFinally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all \ncountries.  \nThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes \ntremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.  \nWorking Men of All Countries, Unite!\n5 \n \n                                                      \n* The party then represented in Parliament by Ledru -Rollin, in literature by Louis  Blanc, in the daily \npress by the R\u00e9forme . The name of Social -Democracy signifies, with these its inventors, a section of \nthe Democratic or Republican Party more or less tinged with socialism. [Engels, English Edition \n1888]"
