The catechism form usual for the sec ret societies of the time and retained in \nthe \u201c Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith\u201d  and \u201c Principles of Communism,\u201d  was not suitable for \na full and substantial exposition of the new revolutionary world outlook, for a comprehensive \nformulation of the pr oletarian movement \u2019s aims and tasks.

        "Hurried by the Central Authority of the Communist League which provided him with certain \ndocuments (e.g., addresses of the People \u2019s Chamber ( Halle ) of the League of t he Just of November \n1846 and February 1847, and, apparently, documents of the First Congress of the Communist League \npertaining to the discussion of the Party programme), Marx worked intensively on the Manifesto  \nthrough almost the whole of January 1848. At  the end of January the manuscript was sent on to \nLondon to be printed in the German Workers \u2019 Educational Society \u2019s print  shop owned by a German \nemigrant J. E.

On February 29, the Educational \nSociety decided to cover all the printing expenses.  \nThe first edition of the Manifesto was a 23- page pamphlet in a dark green cover. In April -May 1848 \nanother edition was put out. The text took up 30 pages, some misprints of the first edition wer e \ncorrected, and the punctuation improved. Subsequently this text was used by Marx and Engels as a \nbasis for later authorised editions. Between March and July 1848 the Manifesto  was printed in the \nDeutsche Londoner Zeitung, a democratic newspaper of the German emigrants. Already that same year numerous efforts were made to publish the Manifesto in other European languages. A Danish, a \nPolish (in Paris) and a Swedish (under a different title: \u201c The Voice of Communism. Declaration of the \nCommunist Party \u201d) editions appeared in 1848.

In April 1848, Engels, then in Barmen, was translating the \nManifesto  into English, but he managed to translate only half of it, and the first E nglish translation, \nmade by Helen Macfarlane, was not published until two years later, between June and November 1850, \nin the Chartist journal The Red Republican.

In 1872 the Manifesto  was first published in America  in Woodhull & Claflin \u2019s \nWeekly. \nThe first Russian edition of the Manifesto , translated by Mikhail Bakunin with some distortions, \nappeared in Geneva in 1869. The faults of this edition were removed in the 1882 edition (tra nslatio n \nby Georgi Plekhanov), for which Marx and Engels, who attributed great significance to the \ndissemination of Marxism in Russia, had written a special preface.  \nAfter Marx \u2019s death, the Manifesto  ran into several editions.

In 1890, Engels \nprepared a further German edition, wrote a new preface to it, and added a number of notes. In 1885, the newspaper Le Socialiste published the French translation of the Manifesto  made by Marx \u2019s \ndaughter Laura Lafargu e and read by Engels. He also wrote prefaces to the 1892 Polish and 1893 \nItalian editions.  \nThis edition includes the two earlier versions of the Manifesto , namely the  draft \u201cCommunist \nConfession of Faith\u201d and \u201cThe Principles of Communism,\u201d both authored by  Engels, as well as the \nletter from Engels to Marx which poses the idea of publishing a \u201cmanifesto,\u201d rather than a catechism. \nThe Manifesto  addressed itself to a mass movement with historical significance, not a political sect.",
