        "Preface to The 1883 German Edition  \nThe preface to the present edition I must, alas, sign alone. Marx, the man to whom the whole \nworking class of Europe and America owes more than to any one else  \u2013 rests at Highgate \nCemet ery and over his grave the first grass is already growing. Since his death [March 14, 1883] , \nthere can be even less thought of revising or supplementing the Manifesto. But I consider it all the \nmore necessary again to state the following expressly:  \nThe basic thought running through the Manifesto \u2013 that economic production, and the structure of \nsociety of every historical epoch necessarily arising therefrom, constitute the foundation for the \npolitical and intellectua l history of that epoch; that consequently (ever since the dissolution of the \nprimaeval communal ownership of land) all history has been a history of class struggles, of \nstruggles between exploited and exploiting, between dominated and dominating classes a t various",
        "primaeval communal ownership of land) all history has been a history of class struggles, of \nstruggles between exploited and exploiting, between dominated and dominating classes a t various \nstages of social evolution; that this struggle, however, has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed class (the proletariat) can no longer emancipate itself from the class \nwhich exploits and oppresses it (the bourgeoisie), without a t the same time forever freeing the \nwhole of society from exploitation, oppression, class struggles  \u2013 this basic thought belongs sole ly \nand exclusively to Marx.\n*  \nI have already stated this many times; but precisely now is it necessary that it also stand i n front \nof the Manifesto itself.  \nFrederick Engels  \nJune 28, 1883, London  \n \n                                                      \n* \u201cThis proposition, \u201d I wrote in the preface to the English translation , \u201cwhich, in my opinion, is destined to do for",

How far I had independently progressed towards it is best shown by my Conditions of the Working Class \nin England . But when I again met Marx at Brussels, in spring  1845, he had it already worked out and put it before me \nin terms almost as clear as those in which I have stated it here. \u201d [Note by Engels to the German edition of 1890]"
